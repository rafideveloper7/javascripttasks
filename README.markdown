# My Code Journey Repository

## My Journey of Coding

Welcome to my coding journey! This repository, `javascripttasks`, is a personal collection of my work as I explore and grow as a developer. It’s not just about JavaScript—it’s a showcase of my full-stack adventures, experiments, and projects across various technologies, languages, and frameworks. From front-end to back-end, databases to DevOps, this repo is where I document my learning, problem-solving, and creative coding endeavors.

### What You'll Find Here
- **Front-End**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Vue, and more for building dynamic user interfaces.
- **Back-End**: Node.js, Express, Python (Flask/Django), and REST/GraphQL APIs.
- **Databases**: Work with SQL (PostgreSQL, MySQL), NoSQL (MongoDB), and database design.
- **DevOps & Tools**: Experiments with Docker, CI/CD pipelines, and cloud platforms.
- **Other Languages**: Explorations in Python, Go, TypeScript, and anything else I’m curious about.
- **Coding Challenges**: Solutions to problems from platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, and more.
- **Full-Stack Projects**: End-to-end applications combining front-end, back-end, and database technologies.
- **Miscellaneous**: Random scripts, automation tools, and creative coding experiments.

### My Learning Path
My journey started with JavaScript, but it’s evolved into a quest to master full-stack development and beyond. Here’s what I’m focusing on:
- **Mastering JavaScript & TypeScript**: From vanilla JS to modern frameworks and type-safe coding.
- **Building Full-Stack Apps**: Combining front-end and back-end to create seamless, scalable applications.
- **Exploring New Tech**: Diving into emerging tools, frameworks, and paradigms to stay ahead.
- **Problem-Solving**: Tackling algorithms and data structures to sharpen my coding skills.
- **Open Source & Collaboration**: Contributing to open-source projects and learning from the community.
