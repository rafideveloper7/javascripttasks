// What is Promise in JavaScript????????

// A Promise is used to handle async work (like data coming later).

// 1) Request is made (something starts)
// 2) Pending – still waiting
// 3) Done – either success (resolved) or failed (rejected)

// JS doesn’t stop, it keeps working while waiting for the Promise.

// Real-life example 1:
// You order food online 🍔
// - You place the order (request)
// - You chill or do other stuff (pending)
// - Rider comes with food = Promise resolved ✅
// - Rider cancels = Promise rejected ❌
// During this time, you don’t just wait — you keep doing your work.

//////////////////////////////////////////

// Real-life example 2:
// You send a friend request on TikTok 👯‍♂️
// - You tap "Add Friend" (request)
// - Waiting for them to accept (pending)
// - They accept = Promise resolved ✅
// - They ignore/reject = Promise rejected ❌
// While waiting, you don’t stop — you keep watching more videos.
